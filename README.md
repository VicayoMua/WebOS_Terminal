# WebOS Terminal

## Project Description

- **Problems:**
    1. Large universities, like UMass, usually provide ssh server environments, like EdLab, for students to get familiar
       with Linux-styled commands. However, most students only use the most basic features on EdLab, so the power
       assumption and the continuous maintenance cost are not worth it.
    2. Students, who are not enrolled in a university and have no previous experience in installing and using Linux,
       usually find it hard to install a Linux distribution on their PCs.

- **Solutions:**
    1. A Linux-terminal simulator accessible with web browsers on mobile devices and PCs can perfectly solve this problem.

- **Key Features:**
    - The Linux-terminal simulator will support the most usual Linux commands, for example, man, ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, 
      rename, touch, cp, edit, and so on.
    - The Linux-terminal simulator includes a file system simulator, so it can natively handle files, folders, and links.
    - Additional buttons outside the terminal window enable the users to save terminal logs, open more terminal tabs, 
      and back up and recover the file system. Hence, the users can easily save and resume their work.
    - Store previously entered commands and allow users to cycle through them using the up/down arrow keys.
