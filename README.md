# WebOS Terminal

## Project Description

- **Problems:**
    1.  Large universities usually provide ssh server environments for students to get familiar with Linux-styled 
        commands. Since only the most basic Linux-commands are frequently used, the power assumption and the 
        continuous maintenance cost are not worth it.
    2.  Students, who have no previous experience with Linux, usually find it hard to install a Linux distribution on 
        their PCs.

- **Solutions:**
    - A Linux-terminal simulator accessible with web browsers on mobile devices and PCs helps.

- **Key Features:**
    - The Linux-terminal simulator will support the most usual Linux commands, for example, man, ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, 
      rename, touch, cp, edit, and so on.
    - The Linux-terminal simulator includes a file system simulator, so it can natively handle files, folders, and links.
    - Additional buttons outside the terminal window enable the users to save terminal logs, open more terminal tabs, 
      and back up and recover the file system. Hence, the users can easily save and resume their work.
    - Store previously entered commands and allow users to cycle through them using the up/down arrow keys.
